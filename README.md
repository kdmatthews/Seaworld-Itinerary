# Sea World Project

## Description

This website was designed to create a Full Stack project as a group. We chose to create a Seaworld itinerary
project where users could select rides and add them to their itinerary. We pulled styling insperation from the
Seaworld website. We also used the website ride names and images to use in our database.

## Key Featrues
-Login Page: This page has two forms one for login and one to create a new user. The create user page
    fetches a route from our backend that allows the user input to be sent to our database.

-Rides Page: This page uses a route to select the ride names and images from our database. In the frontend
    we then fetch this route and use DOM manipulation to display the information on our page. Here users
    can add rides to the itinerary page. The rides will be added via an update route.

-Itinerary Page: This page also uses DOM manipulation to display information from our database. Here the users
    will see the rides they have added to their itinerary and be able to delete them. In order to make the
    delete function work we needed a delete route on our backend.
